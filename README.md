## [Credit to youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) & [Credit to FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)
#### A simple batch GUI for the very popular "Youtube-DL" application
##### This application is for downloading youtube videos/audio with the Youtube-DL Python program in a more user friendly manner
##### For more information, visit [the youtube-dl github](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme)
#### This is the FFMpeg included version, This means:
- This version supports audio downloading out of the box
- It is *nearly* 20x larger than the FFMpeg excluded version
- Does not have options to connect to an already installed FFMpeg (Costing you space if its already installed)
#### [FFMpeg excluded version](https://github.com/Paradigm0001/YoutubeDLBatchUI-FFMpeg_ex)

##### To access the source code, Right click on the .bat file and select `edit` or open with your selected text editor.

## `This project is no longer maintained.`
I am planning on moving to Bash and other UNIX based scripting languages, and therefore leaving batch behind.

Due to how I built this batch file, youtube-dl will always be up to date and I dont see any potential for it to break.

If youtube-dl does have a massive rework I may look at fixing this batch file, however that chance still slim.
